The application is composed by 
single node code
interface to add transactions and start mining process

flask framework is needed to be able to create nodes locally
At the moment is running only locally, but it can be set in a server with a few modifications

to create a node:
#first node
cmd
set FLASK_APP=route.py
flask run --port 8000

#second node
cmd
set FLASK_APP=route.py
flask run --port 8001

127.0.0.1:8000
127.0.0.1:8001
are the two url addresses of the node created. can use them singolarly or can link them sending a JSON POST request using a tool like Postman or curl:
to hook 8001 with 8000, having 8000 as transactions pool holder:
json post request to http://127.0.0.1:8001/register-with
{"address": "http://127.0.0.1:8000"}

available routes:
/add-transactions
/mine
/chain


to run the interface to easily add transactions to the nodes without using postman
cmd
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run --port 5000

interface is harcoded linked to the 8000 port node being the transaction holder. Not ideal but it can be modified
available routes:
/
/mine

to set off all the network to mine, use the route in the interface (the network need to be alredy set up with the links using /register-with node route)

It is confusing, I know
